# tws-cli

A C# command-line interface for the IB Trader Workstation trading platform.

To use this app you must have a brokerage account with [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php). You must also have Trader Workstation installed and running on the same machine. This is so that the cli client can open a localhost TCP connection with Trader Workstation and send messages back and forth using the Trader Workstation [API](http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/index.html).

The cli client is built on top of an example [API client](http://interactivebrokers.github.io) provided by IB.
